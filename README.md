# Eye-contolled-mouse
A computer cursor by using face and eyes
This project goal is to build a system that allows users to interface with computers by moving their heads and blinking their eyes. 
It's an eye primarily based interface that acts as a laptop mouse to translate eye actions such as blinking, moving head in the direction of the mouse cursor actions. 
For physically challenged people, the idea of controlling computers with their eyes and head will be extremely useful. 
The system track the computer users head movements with a video camera and translates them into the movements of the mouse pointer on the screen and it also detect the user eye blink and translates them into mouse click events on computer screen. 
Computers have become an inevitable part of human life. Traditional computer mouse is the basic approach to move the cursor on the screen. 
There are systems in place that allow users to communicate with the computer without the need of physical contact. 
we have proposed a methodology for operating computer cursor using eye and face movements, which facilitates operations such as left click, move the cursor up, down, left, right. 
World-wide there are many users who, due to their physical disability are not able to use their hands or any part of body and want to access the computer in any other way. 
The goal of our system is to efficiently track the head movement of a person from web-cam or from external web-cam.
